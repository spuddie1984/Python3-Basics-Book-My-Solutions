# A factor of a positive integer n is any positive integer less than or equal
# to n that divides n with no remainder.
# For example, 3 is a factor of 12 because 12 divided by 3 is 4, with no
# remainder. However, 5 is not a factor of 12 because 5 goes into 12 twice
# with a remainder of 2.
# Write a script that asks the user to input a positive integer
# and then prints out the factors of that number. Hereâ€™s a sample run
# of the program with output:
#   Enter a positive integer: 12
#       1 is a factor of 12
#       2 is a factor of 12
#       3 is a factor of 12
#       4 is a factor of 12
#       6 is a factor of 12
#       12 is a factor of 12

# get user input 
user_input = int(input('Please input a positive integer: '))

# print out the factors of the user inputted integer
def factor_checker(factor):
    # loop through from 1 to factor number
    for num in range(1,factor + 1):
        if(factor % num == 0):
            print(f'{num} is a factor of {factor}')

# call the function on user_input 
factor_checker(user_input)
