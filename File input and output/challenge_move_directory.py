'''
In the chapter 12 practice_files folder, there is a subfolder called
documents/. The directory contains several files and subfolders. Some
of the files are images ending with the .png, .gif, or .jpg file extension.
Create a new folder in the practice_files folder called images/, and
move all image files to that folder. When youâ€™re done, the new folder
should have four files in it:
1. image1.png
2. image2.gif
3. image3.png
4. image4.jpg
