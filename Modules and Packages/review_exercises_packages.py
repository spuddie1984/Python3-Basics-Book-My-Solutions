1. In a new project folder called package_exercises/ , create a package
called helpers with three modules: __init__.py , string.py , and
math.py .

In the string.py module, add a function called shout() that
takes a single string parameter and returns a new string with all
of the letters in uppercase.
In the math.py module, add a function called area() that takes
two parameters called length and width and returns their product
length * width .

2. In the root project folder, create a module called main.py that
imports the shout() and area() functions. Use shout() and area()
to print the following output:
THE AREA OF A 5-BY-8 RECTANGLE IS 40
